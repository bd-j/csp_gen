To Do
------
 1. ~~deal with zero bin~~
 2. ~~write SFR integrator and SFR value functions, and simplify simha_norm to use functions from 2.~~
 4. ~~deal with sfstart~~
 5. ~~rename `sfhint` to `intsfwght`, so `sfhinfo` can use `sfrint` with less confusion.~~
 6. deal with setting up sfhtab properly, check slope definition
 7. deal with multi-metallicity, especially for tabular. 
 8. ~~write the burst case into `sfh_weight` (and `convert_sfhparams`)~~
 9. ~~check and fix `locate` usage~~
 10. ~~write interfaces~~
 11. ~~make sure all functions properly available.~~
 12. move renormalization of `csp_gen` output to within `csp_gen`
